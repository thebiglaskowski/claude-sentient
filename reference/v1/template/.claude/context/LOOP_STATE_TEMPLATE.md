## Iteration History

### Iteration 1
- **Time:** [timestamp]
- **Focus:** [what was worked on]
- **Result:** [outcome]
- **Gates Changed:** [which gates changed status]
- **Decisions:** [any decisions made, reference IDs]
- **Checkpoint:** [commit hash if created, or "none"]

## Stuck Detection

| Metric | Value | Threshold |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Iterations without progress | 0 | 2 (triggers reassess) |
| Same gate failed consecutively | 0 | 3 (triggers pivot) |
| Coverage change last 2 iterations | — | Must be positive |

---

## Exit Criteria

All must be true to exit:

- [ ] All 15 quality gates passing
- [ ] Work queue empty
- [ ] 2 consecutive passing iterations
- [ ] Verification iteration confirms stability
- [ ] All decisions logged
- [ ] Final checkpoint created
