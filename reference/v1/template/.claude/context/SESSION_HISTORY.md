# Session History

Cross-session persistence for learnings, decisions, and patterns discovered.

---

## Purpose

This file persists knowledge across conversations so future sessions can:
- Avoid repeating discoveries
- Remember project-specific patterns
- Recall past decisions and their reasoning
- Build on previous work without context loss

---

## How It Works

1. **During Session:** Important learnings are noted here
2. **Session End:** Summary added to history
3. **New Session:** Read this file first to restore context
4. **Over Time:** Patterns emerge, decisions accumulate

---

2. **Check Session Log** for recent context
3. **Review Gotchas** to avoid known issues
4. **Note patterns** to follow established conventions
5. **Update this file** when session ends

When ending a session:

1. **Add session entry** at top of Session Log
2. **Update patterns** if new ones discovered
3. **Add gotchas** if issues encountered
