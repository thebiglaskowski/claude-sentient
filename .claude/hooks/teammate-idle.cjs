/**
 * TeammateIdle Hook — Quality gate enforcement for Agent Teams
 *
 * Runs when a teammate is about to go idle. Checks if the teammate's
 * work passes basic quality checks before allowing them to stop.
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 — Allow teammate to go idle (quality OK or no checks applicable)
 *   2 — Send feedback to teammate (quality issues found, keep working)
 *
 * Hook input (via HOOK_INPUT env var or stdin):
 * {
 *   "teammate_name": "frontend",
 *   "session_id": "...",
 *   "tasks_completed": [...],
 *   "working_directory": "/path/to/project"
 * }
