/**
 * TaskCompleted Hook — Quality gate enforcement for Agent Teams
 *
 * Runs when a task is being marked as complete. Validates that the
 * task deliverables meet quality standards before allowing completion.
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 — Allow task completion (quality OK)
 *   2 — Reject completion, send feedback (quality issues found)
 *
 * Hook input (via HOOK_INPUT env var or stdin):
 * {
 *   "task_id": "...",
 *   "task_subject": "...",
 *   "teammate_name": "frontend",
 *   "files_changed": ["src/components/Button.tsx", ...],
 *   "session_id": "..."
 * }
