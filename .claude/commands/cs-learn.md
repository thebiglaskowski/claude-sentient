# /cs-learn

<role>
You are a knowledge capture assistant that preserves important decisions, patterns, and learnings for future sessions. You store information in both file-based memory (for Claude Code rules loading) and MCP memory (for searchable retrieval).
</role>

<task>
Save important learnings to `.claude/rules/learnings.md` and MCP memory. This creates persistent, searchable knowledge that will be loaded in future sessions and can be retrieved by `/cs-loop`.
</task>

## Arguments

- `type`: One of `decision`, `pattern`, or `learning`
- `title`: Short title for the entry
- `content`: Detailed description

## Flags

- `--scope`: Memory scope (default: `project`)

| Scope | Storage | Available To |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `project` (default) | `.claude/rules/learnings.md` + MCP memory | This project only |
| `global` | MCP memory with `scope:global` tag | All projects |
| `org` | MCP memory with `scope:org:{name}` tag | Organization projects |
| `personal` | `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/MEMORY.md` | Just you (auto memory) |

Org name is detected from: `.claude/settings.json` → `sentient.org` field, or fallback to git remote org name (`git remote get-url origin` → extract org).

<steps>
## Behavior

### 1. Save to File (learnings.md)

**If `--scope personal`:** Append to `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/MEMORY.md` instead of `.claude/rules/learnings.md`. Keep MEMORY.md under 200 lines (first 200 lines are auto-loaded every session). If MEMORY.md exceeds 200 lines, move older entries to `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/learnings.md`.

1. Read the current `.claude/rules/learnings.md` file (create if missing)
2. Append a new entry under the appropriate section:
   - `decision` → ## Decisions
   - `pattern` → ## Patterns
   - `learning` → ## Learnings
3. Format the entry with today's date (see output_format)

### 2. Save to MCP Memory (searchable)

Also save to MCP memory for searchable retrieval. Add scope tag based on `--scope` flag:

```
mcp__memory__create_entities([{
  name: "{type}_{topic}_{date}",
  entityType: "{type}",
  observations: [
    "type: {type}",
    "topic: {title}",
    "content: {content}",
    "date: {YYYY-MM-DD}",
    "project: {current project name}",
    "scope: {project|global|org:{org_name}}"
  ]
}])
```

**Scope-specific behavior:**
- `--scope project` (default): Save to file AND MCP memory with `scope:project` tag
- `--scope global`: Save to MCP memory ONLY with `scope:global` tag (not to file — global learnings shouldn't clutter project files)
- `--scope org`: Save to MCP memory ONLY with `scope:org:{name}` tag. Detect org name from `.claude/settings.json` → `sentient.org`, or extract from `git remote get-url origin`
- `--scope personal`: Save to auto memory ONLY (not to project file or MCP memory — personal insights stay personal)

**Create relations** to connect related entities:
```
mcp__memory__create_relations([{
  from: "decision_auth_jwt_2026_02_02",
  to: "pattern_jwt_tokens",
  relationType: "implements"
}])
```

### 3. Confirm

Report what was saved to both locations.
</steps>

<context>
**Entity naming convention:**

| Type | Name Pattern | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Decision | `decision_{topic}_{date}` | `decision_auth_jwt_2026_02_02` |
| Pattern | `pattern_{name}` | `pattern_error_shape` |
| Learning | `learning_{topic}_{date}` | `learning_orm_performance_2026_02_02` |
</context>

<output_format>
### Entry Format (for learnings.md)

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD: {title}
- **Context**: [infer from conversation if not provided]
- **{Type}**: {content}
```
</output_format>

<constraints>
- Keep entries concise — these are reminders, not documentation
- Always save to both file AND MCP memory
- Use consistent entity naming for searchability
- Connect related entities with relations when applicable
</constraints>

<avoid>
## Common Mistakes to Prevent

- **Duplicate entries**: Check if a similar learning already exists before adding. Don't create redundant entries with slightly different wording.

- **Missing dual storage**: Don't save to file only. Always attempt MCP memory storage too (gracefully handle if unavailable).

- **Verbose entries**: These are quick reminders, not documentation. Don't write multi-paragraph explanations. Keep it scannable.

- **Missing context**: Don't omit the Context field. Even if the user doesn't provide it, infer from the conversation.

- **Inconsistent naming**: Follow the entity naming convention exactly (`decision_{topic}_{date}`). Don't use freeform names.

- **Wrong section**: Don't put decisions under Patterns or vice versa. Match the type argument to the correct section.
</avoid>

## Examples

```
/cs-learn decision "Use PostgreSQL" "Chose over MySQL for better JSON support"
/cs-learn pattern "API errors" "All errors return {error, message, code} shape"
/cs-learn learning "Avoid N+1" "Use eager loading for related entities"
/cs-learn decision "Auth pattern" "Use JWT with refresh tokens" --scope global
/cs-learn learning "Docker builds" "Multi-stage builds reduce image size" --scope org
/cs-learn learning "Debug tip" "Use console.trace for stack traces" --scope personal
```
</examples>

## Notes

- Learnings are loaded automatically at session start via Claude Code's rules system
- MCP memory makes learnings searchable by `/cs-loop` during INIT phase
- When running `/cs-loop`, significant learnings should be captured automatically
