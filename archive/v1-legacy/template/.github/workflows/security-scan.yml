# Claude Code Security Scan
# Automated security audit using Claude Code in headless mode
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to repository secrets
# 2. Install Claude Code CLI in your CI environment
#
# Usage:
# - Triggers on push to main/master and PRs
# - Can be triggered manually via workflow_dispatch
# - Posts security findings as PR comments or creates issues

          Check for:
          1. OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
             - Injection (SQL, NoSQL, Command, LDAP)
             - Broken Authentication

             - Insecure Deserialization
             - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
             - Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

          2. Secret/Credential exposure
             - Hardcoded API keys, passwords, tokens
             - Sensitive data in logs
             - Credentials in config files

          3. Authentication/Authorization issues
             - Missing auth checks
             - Privilege escalation paths
             - Session management flaws

          4. Input validation
             - Unsanitized user input
             - Missing type checking
             - Buffer overflow potential

          5. Cryptographic issues
             - Weak algorithms
             - Improper key management
             - Missing encryption
