## Introduction

I'm Boris and I created Claude Code. I wanted to quickly share a few tips for using Claude Code, sourced directly from the Claude Code team. The way the team uses Claude is different than how I use it.

**Remember:** There is no one right way to use Claude Code — everyone's setup is different. You should experiment to see what works for you!

## 1. Do More in Parallel

Spin up **3–5 git worktrees** at once, each running its own Claude session in parallel. It's the single biggest productivity unlock, and the top tip from the team.

Personally, I use multiple git checkouts, but most of the Claude Code team prefers worktrees — it's the reason `@amorriscode` built native support for them into the Claude Desktop app!

**Team Tips:**
- Some people name their worktrees and set up shell aliases (`za`, `zb`, `zc`) so they can hop between them in one keystroke
- Others have a dedicated "analysis" worktree that's only for reading logs and running BigQuery

## 2. Start Every Complex Task in Plan Mode

Pour your energy into the plan so Claude can **1-shot the implementation**.

**Team Approaches:**
- One person has one Claude write the plan, then spins up a **second Claude to review it as a staff engineer**
- Another says the moment something goes sideways, they switch back to plan mode and re-plan — **don't keep pushing**
- They also explicitly tell Claude to enter plan mode for verification steps, not just for the build

## 3. Invest in Your CLAUDE.md

After every correction, end with:

> *"Update your CLAUDE.md so you don't make that mistake again."*

Claude is eerily good at writing rules for itself.

**Best Practices:**
- Ruthlessly edit your `CLAUDE.md` over time
- Keep iterating until Claude's mistake rate measurably drops
- One engineer tells Claude to maintain a **notes directory** for every task/project, updated after every PR, then points `CLAUDE.md` at it

---

## 4. Create Your Own Skills and Commit Them to Git

Reuse across every project.

**Team Tips:**
- If you do something more than once a day, **turn it into a skill or command**
- Build a `/techdebt` slash command and run it at the end of every session to find and kill duplicated code
- Set up a slash command that syncs 7 days of Slack, GDrive, Asana, and GitHub into one context dump
- Build analytics-engineer-style agents that write dbt models, review code, and test changes in dev

## 5. Claude Fixes Most Bugs by Itself

Here's how we do it:

**Methods:**
- Enable the **Slack MCP**, then paste a Slack bug thread into Claude and just say "fix." Zero context switching required.
- Just say *"Go fix the failing CI tests."* Don't micromanage how.
- Point Claude at **docker logs** to troubleshoot distributed systems — it's surprisingly capable at this

> *PS: I prefer Discord hooks*

## 6. Level Up Your Prompting

### a. Challenge Claude

Say:
> *"Grill me on these changes and don't make a PR until I pass your test."*

Make Claude be your reviewer. Or, say:
> *"Prove to me this works"*

Have Claude diff behavior between `main` and your feature branch.

### b. After a Mediocre Fix

Say:
> *"Knowing everything you know now, scrap this and implement the elegant solution."*

### c. Reduce Ambiguity

Write detailed specs and reduce ambiguity before handing work off. **The more specific you are, the better the output.**

---

## 7. Terminal & Environment Setup

### Terminal Recommendations

The team loves **Ghostty**! Multiple people like its:
- Synchronized rendering
- 24-bit color
- Proper unicode support

### Claude Juggling Tips

- Use `/statusline` to customize your status bar to always show **context usage** and **current git branch**
- Many of us color-code and name our terminal tabs, sometimes using **tmux** — one tab per task/worktree

### Voice Dictation

Use voice dictation! You speak **3x faster** than you type, and your prompts get way more detailed as a result.

> *Hit `fn` x2 on macOS*

> **Docs:** [Terminal configuration](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/terminal-config)
> *PS: I mainly use PowerShell and WSL2 sometimes*

---

## 8. Use Subagents

### a. Throw More Compute at Problems

Append **"use subagents"** to any request where you want Claude to throw more compute at the problem.

### b. Keep Context Clean

Offload individual tasks to subagents to keep your main agent's context window clean and focused.

### c. Auto-Approve Safe Operations

Route permission requests to **Opus 4.5** via a hook — let it scan for attacks and auto-approve the safe ones.

> **Docs:** [Permission request hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks#permissionrequest)

---

## 9. Use Claude for Data & Analytics

Ask Claude Code to use the **`bq` CLI** to pull and analyze metrics on the fly. We have a BigQuery skill checked into the codebase, and everyone on the team uses it for analytics queries directly in Claude Code.

**Personally, I haven't written a line of SQL in 6+ months.**

This works for any database that has a CLI, MCP, or API.

## 10. Learning with Claude

A few tips from the team to use Claude Code for learning:

### a. Enable Learning Mode

Enable the **"Explanatory"** or **"Learning"** output style in `/config` to have Claude explain the *why* behind its changes.

### b. Visual Presentations

Have Claude generate a **visual HTML presentation** explaining unfamiliar code. It makes surprisingly good slides!

### c. ASCII Diagrams

Ask Claude to draw **ASCII diagrams** of new protocols and codebases to help you understand them.

### d. Spaced-Repetition Learning

Build a spaced-repetition learning skill:
1. You explain your understanding
2. Claude asks follow-ups to fill gaps
3. Stores the result for later review
