# Claude Sentient

> **Autonomous development orchestration for Claude Code**

Claude Sentient coordinates Claude Code's native capabilities into an autonomous development workflow. It's not a replacement — it's a thin orchestration layer that makes built-in tools work together cohesively.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

**This is an experimental orchestration framework.** Claude Sentient provides prompts, profiles, and configurations designed to enhance Claude Code workflows. Results may vary.

- **Not a guarantee** — These prompts guide Claude but don't guarantee specific outcomes
- **Your responsibility** — Always review Claude's output before committing changes
- **Evolving project** — Expect changes between versions
- **Native-first** — Uses Claude Code's built-in tools, not custom replacements

## 🤖 What is Claude Sentient?

Claude Sentient transforms Claude Code sessions into **autonomous development loops**:

```
USER REQUEST → INIT → PLAN → EXECUTE → VERIFY → COMMIT → DONE
                ↓        ↓         ↓         ↓
           Profile   TaskCreate  Work    Quality
           Detection            Items    Gates
```

**Philosophy:** Claude Code already has task management, planning modes, sub-agents, and memory. We don't reinvent these — we orchestrate them.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

### One-Line Install

**Bash (Linux/Mac):**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thebiglaskowski/claude-sentient/main/install.sh | bash
```

**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thebiglaskowski/claude-sentient/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

### After Installation

```bash
/cs-validate              # Verify setup
/cs-status                # See detected profile
/cs-loop "your task"      # Start working
```

### Uninstall

**Bash (Linux/Mac):**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thebiglaskowski/claude-sentient/main/uninstall.sh | bash
```

**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thebiglaskowski/claude-sentient/main/uninstall.ps1 | iex
```

**Or run locally:**
```bash
./uninstall.sh                # Standard uninstall
./uninstall.sh --dry-run      # Preview what would be removed
./uninstall.sh --purge        # Also remove learnings.md
./uninstall.sh --keep-settings  # Don't touch .claude/settings.json
```

By default, `learnings.md` (your decisions/patterns) is preserved and `settings.json` is backed up to `.bak`. `CLAUDE.md` is left for manual removal.

## 📋 Profile Detection

Sentient auto-detects your project type and loads appropriate tooling. See [`profiles/`](profiles/) for full configurations.

| Profile | Detected By | Tools | Config |
|---------|-------------|-------|--------|
| Python | `pyproject.toml`, `*.py` | ruff, pytest, pyright | [python.yaml](profiles/python.yaml) |
| TypeScript | `tsconfig.json`, `*.ts` | eslint, vitest, tsc | [typescript.yaml](profiles/typescript.yaml) |
| Go | `go.mod`, `*.go` | golangci-lint, go test | [go.yaml](profiles/go.yaml) |
| Rust | `Cargo.toml` | clippy, cargo test | [rust.yaml](profiles/rust.yaml) |
| Java | `pom.xml`, `build.gradle` | checkstyle, JUnit | [java.yaml](profiles/java.yaml) |
| C/C++ | `CMakeLists.txt`, `Makefile` | clang-tidy, ctest | [cpp.yaml](profiles/cpp.yaml) |
| Ruby | `Gemfile` | rubocop, rspec | [ruby.yaml](profiles/ruby.yaml) |
| Shell | `*.sh`, `*.ps1` | shellcheck | [shell.yaml](profiles/shell.yaml) |
| General | (fallback) | auto-detect | [general.yaml](profiles/general.yaml) |

### Python Environment Detection

For Python projects, Sentient detects and uses the correct environment:

| Indicator | Environment | How Commands Run |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| `environment.yml` | Conda | `conda run -n <env> pytest` |
| `.venv/`, `venv/` | Virtualenv | Uses venv's Python |
| `poetry.lock` | Poetry | `poetry run pytest` |
| `pdm.lock` | PDM | `pdm run pytest` |

---

## 🔄 The Loop

When you run `/cs-loop`, Claude Sentient orchestrates:

```
Phase 1: INIT       → Detect profile, load rules, check governance
Phase 2: UNDERSTAND → Classify complexity (simple/moderate/complex)
Phase 3: PLAN       → Create tasks via TaskCreate
Phase 4: EXECUTE    → Work through tasks, update status
Phase 5: VERIFY     → Run quality gates (lint, test, build)
Phase 6: COMMIT     → Create checkpoint commit
Phase 7: EVALUATE   → Done? Exit. More work? Loop.
```

### 🚦 Quality Gates

All gates must pass before committing:

| Gate | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| ✅ LINT | Zero errors from linter |
| ✅ TEST | All tests pass |
| ✅ BUILD | Project builds successfully |
| ✅ GIT | Clean working state |

---

## 🔗 MCP Server Integration

Claude Sentient can leverage MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for extended capabilities. See [full MCP documentation](CLAUDE.md#mcp-server-integration) for details.

| Server | Purpose | Auto-Used By |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **context7** | Library documentation | `/cs-loop` INIT (fetches docs for imports) |
| **github** | GitHub API (PRs, issues, code search) | `/cs-loop` INIT/VERIFY, `/cs-review` |
| **memory** | Searchable knowledge graph | `/cs-loop` INIT (search prior decisions), `/cs-learn` |
| **filesystem** | File system access | Manual |
| **puppeteer** | Browser automation | `/cs-loop` VERIFY (web projects) |

### Setup MCP Servers

```bash
/cs-mcp              # Check what's configured vs connected
/cs-mcp --fix        # Auto-register servers from settings.json
/cs-mcp --test       # Validate servers are responding
```

**Note:** MCP servers are registered at the user level (`~/.claude.json`). Once registered, they're available in all projects.

---

## 🔌 Plugins

The installer auto-installs recommended plugins from the Claude Code official marketplace when the `claude` CLI is available. Plugin installation is non-fatal — if `claude` isn't found or a plugin fails to install, setup continues normally.

### Auto-Installed Plugins

**Security Guidance** (all projects, user scope):

`security-guidance@claude-plugins-official` scans file content for security anti-patterns like `eval()`, `pickle.loads()`, unsanitized HTML injection, and hardcoded secrets. It complements the bash-validator and file-validator hooks that ship with Claude Sentient by catching patterns at the content level rather than the command level.

**LSP Plugins** (profile-dependent, project scope):

Each language profile declares a recommended LSP plugin that gives Claude deeper understanding of your code — real-time type information, symbol resolution, and diagnostics that go beyond static file reading.

| Profile | Plugin | What It Adds |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Python | `pyright-lsp` | Type inference, import resolution, missing attribute detection |
| TypeScript | `typescript-lsp` | Type checking, module resolution, refactoring support |
| Go | `gopls-lsp` | Type analysis, interface satisfaction, unused variable detection |
| Rust | `rust-analyzer-lsp` | Borrow checker insights, trait resolution, macro expansion |
| Java | `jdtls-lsp` | Class hierarchy, dependency analysis, annotation processing |
| C/C++ | `clangd-lsp` | Header resolution, compile command awareness, memory safety hints |
| Ruby, Shell, General | — | No LSP plugin (profile tools handle linting directly) |

### Recommended Plugins (Optional)

These are not auto-installed but are shown in the installer summary for manual setup:

```bash
claude plugin install pr-review-toolkit@claude-plugins-official   # Enhanced PR review workflows
claude plugin install ralph-loop@claude-plugins-official           # Advanced loop orchestration
```

### Checking Plugin Status

Run `/cs-validate` to see which plugins are installed and which are missing. The PLUGINS advisory section shows installed, missing, and optional plugins with one-liner install commands.

## 🛠️ Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Feature Development

```bash
# 1. Start with planning for complex features
/cs-plan "add JWT authentication"

# Claude explores codebase, creates a plan, asks for approval
# After approval, you can execute immediately or later:

# 2. Execute the plan
/cs-loop "implement the JWT auth plan"

# Claude: INIT → detects TypeScript profile
#         PLAN → creates tasks with dependencies
#         EXECUTE → implements auth module, tests, docs
#         VERIFY → runs eslint, vitest
#         COMMIT → creates checkpoint "feat: add JWT authentication"
```

### Workflow 2: Bug Fix

```bash
# For simpler bugs, go straight to loop
/cs-loop "fix the race condition in user login #142"

# Claude automatically:
# - Fetches issue #142 details via MCP github
# - Investigates the code
# - Creates minimal fix
# - Runs tests
# - Commits with "fix: resolve login race condition (closes #142)"
```

### Workflow 3: Code Review + Fix

```bash
# 1. Review a PR
/cs-review 47

# Claude analyzes PR #47, provides detailed feedback with file:line refs

# 2. If issues found, fix them
/cs-loop "address review comments on PR #47"
```

### Workflow 4: Codebase Health Check

```bash
# 1. Full assessment
/cs-assess

# Claude provides scores (1-10) for:
# - Architecture, Code Quality, Security
# - Performance, Tech Debt, Test Coverage
# - UI/UX (for web projects)

# 2. Address issues
/cs-loop "fix all immediate priority items from assessment"
```

### Workflow 5: Learning from Mistakes

```bash
# Claude makes a mistake, you correct it
> "Don't use any types in this project"

# Save the learning for future sessions
/cs-learn pattern "No any types" "Use explicit types, never any"

# Or Claude proposes it after correction:
# "Should I add a rule to prevent this?"
```

### Workflow 6: Resuming Work

```bash
# Check where you left off
/cs-status

# Shows: Profile, Tasks (3 pending, 1 in progress), Git state

# Continue from where you stopped
/cs-loop "continue"  # Or just describe what's next
```

### Workflow 7: UI/UX Audit (Web Projects)

```bash
# For React/Vue/Next.js projects
/cs-ui

# Claude audits against modern design standards:
# - Spacing (8px grid), Typography, Colors
# - Components, Accessibility, Responsiveness
# - Provides before/after code examples
```

### Workflow 8: Context Architecture

```bash
# Create CLAUDE.md for a new project
/cs-init

# Claude analyzes project, detects tech stack, creates:
# - Root CLAUDE.md (overview, quality philosophy, tech stack)
# - Nested CLAUDE.md files for significant directories
# - Zero-tolerance quality philosophy injected by default

# Or optimize an existing monolithic CLAUDE.md
/cs-init  # Detects existing CLAUDE.md, offers to split into nested files
```

### Workflow 9: Parallel Work with Agent Teams

```bash
# For large tasks across multiple packages/modules
/cs-loop "refactor auth across all packages"

# cs-loop detects 6 independent tasks across 3 packages
# Offers team mode: "3 parallel teammates. Use Agent Teams?"
# If yes: spawns teammates, each owns a package
# Lead coordinates, teammates work in parallel
# Quality gates enforced via TeammateIdle/TaskCompleted hooks

# Or create a team manually
/cs-team "investigate performance bottleneck from 3 angles"

# Check team status
/cs-team --status

# Stop and cleanup
/cs-team --stop
```

### Workflow 10: MCP Server Setup

```bash
# First time setup
/cs-mcp --fix      # Auto-register servers from settings.json
/cs-mcp --test     # Verify all servers respond

# Now /cs-loop will:
# - Fetch library docs via Context7
# - Link commits to GitHub issues
# - Search prior decisions from Memory
```

## 🧪 Tests

Test suites validate hooks, profiles, commands, agents, schemas, and cross-module integrity:

```bash
# Profile validation (242 tests) — schema compliance, gates, infrastructure, cross-profile consistency
node profiles/__tests__/test-profiles.js

# Agent validation (159 tests) — YAML schema, roles, expertise, spawn_prompts
node agents/__tests__/test-agents.js

# Hook tests (266 tests) — security, I/O contracts, Agent Teams, context predictions
node .claude/hooks/__tests__/test-hooks.js

# Command validation (93 tests) — frontmatter, structure, auto-fix, deploy, skill chaining
node .claude/commands/__tests__/test-commands.js

# Schema validation (214 tests) — JSON schema structure, profile/agent/gate compliance, cross-module integrity
node schemas/__tests__/test-schemas.js

# Integration tests (69 tests) — cross-file references, hook chain flow, install/uninstall parity, doc consistency, plugin parity, MCP degradation
node integration/__tests__/test-integration.js
```

All core test suites use shared `test-utils.js` with built-in `assert` — zero external dependencies.
